# About

This is an un-official fork of the Lapos tagger, based on version 0.1.2. [Official source available here](http://www.logos.ic.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tsuruoka/lapos/).

The goal of this fork is to add Unicode support for use in the Classical Language Toolkit. Once fixed, the CLTK hopes that these changes will be merged.

For all technical details, see `README` and for license `LICENSE`.
