# About

This is an un-official fork of the Lapos tagger, based on version 0.1.2. [Official source available here](http://www.logos.ic.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tsuruoka/lapos/).

The goal of this fork is to add Unicode support for use in the Classical Language Toolkit. Once fixed, the CLTK hopes that these changes will be merged upstream.
